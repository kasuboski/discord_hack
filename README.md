# AI Team Bot - Discord RAG Assistant

The **AI Team Bot** is a multi-persona AI agent for Discord with this example designed for development teams. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide contextually relevant answers from project-specific knowledge bases. The system features distinct AI "personas" (e.g., Project Manager, Lead Architect) that can be directly mentioned for targeted queries. The bot uses an LLM based router to automatically route queries to the appropriate persona along with relevant conversational context.

Built with Python, discord.py, pydantic-ai, and powered by Meta Llama models via the Cerebras API.

## ü§ñ Features

- **Multi-Persona Support**: Interact with a team of AI assistants, each with a unique personality, avatar, and knowledge base (e.g., `@JohnPM`, `@SarahArch`).
- **Persona Mention Detection**: Mention a persona directly (`@PersonaName`) to get a targeted answer from their specific domain of expertise.
- **Webhook-Based Impersonation**: Each persona responds with their own name and a unique, dynamically generated avatar.
- **Persona-Specific RAG**: Each persona has an isolated knowledge base, ensuring domain-specific and contextually relevant answers.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Personas are defined and managed through `personas.json`, allowing for easy customization.
- **General Bot Interaction**: Mention the bot by its name (`@AITeamBot`) for general questions.
- **Proactive Interjections**: The bot will automatically interject with a personalized response based on the conversation context.

## Usage

### Interacting with the Bot

- **General Question**: `@AITeamBot What is the project architecture?`
- **Persona-Specific Question**: `@JohnPM how should we prioritize these features?`
- **Empty Mention**: `@AITeamBot` (The bot will greet you)

The bot will detect the mention and route the query to the appropriate agent.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Discord bot token
- Cerebras API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd discord_hack
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
uv install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_discord_bot_token_here"
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY="your_cerebras_api_key_here"
```

### Running the Bot

Start the Discord bot:
```bash
uv run src/main.py discord
```


## Development

### Running Commands

- **Run Tests**:
  ```bash
  uv run pytest
  ```
- **Lint and Format Code**:
  ```bash
  uv run ruff check --fix
  uv run ruff format
  ```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The bot's architecture is designed around a multi-persona, RAG-based system. For a detailed overview, see [docs/arch.md](docs/arch.md).

### Core Components

- **Discord Bot** (`discord_bot.py`): Manages Discord API integration, message handling, and webhook-based responses.
- **RAG Agent** (`agent.py`): Core AI agent that uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
- **Configuration Manager** (`config.py`): Loads and manages persona definitions from `personas.json`.
- **Webhook Manager** (`webhook_manager.py`): Handles the creation and caching of Discord webhooks for persona impersonation.
- **Knowledge Bases**: Text files in the `kbs/` directory, with each persona having its own dedicated knowledge source.

## Features

### Architecture
- Modular agent system with caching for performance
- Configuration-driven persona management
- Semantic conversation threading
- Context-aware message routing
- Robust error handling and logging

## üîß Configuration

### Personas
Personas are configured in `personas.json`. Each persona has a name, role, system prompt, and a path to their knowledge base.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | Your Discord bot token |
| `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` | Yes | Your Cerebras API key for Llama models |
