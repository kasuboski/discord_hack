# Project Management Knowledge Base - John Parker

## Project Management Fundamentals

### Agile Methodologies
- **Scrum**: 2-4 week sprints with daily standups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives
- **Kanban**: Continuous flow with WIP limits and visual board management
- **Sprint Planning**: Define sprint goals, estimate story points, assign tasks
- **Daily Standups**: What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Any blockers?

### Project Planning Best Practices
- Break down large features into smaller, manageable tasks (2-8 hour chunks)
- Use story points for relative estimation (Fibonacci sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
- Define clear acceptance criteria for each user story
- Maintain a prioritized backlog with business value alignment
- Plan for 70-80% capacity to account for unexpected work

### Risk Management
- **Technical Risks**: Unproven technologies, complex integrations, performance concerns
- **Resource Risks**: Team member availability, skill gaps, dependencies on external teams
- **Timeline Risks**: Scope creep, unrealistic estimates, external dependencies
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Proof of concepts, cross-training, buffer time, contingency plans

### Stakeholder Communication
- **Weekly Status Reports**: Progress against milestones, blockers, next week's goals
- **Sprint Demos**: Show working software to stakeholders every 2-4 weeks
- **Escalation Paths**: Clear process for raising blockers and issues
- **Change Requests**: Formal process for scope changes with impact analysis

### Common Project Challenges
- **Scope Creep**: New requirements added without adjusting timeline/resources
- **Technical Debt**: Balance between speed and code quality
- **Resource Constraints**: Team members pulled to other priorities
- **Dependencies**: Waiting on external teams, third-party services, or approvals

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Velocity**: Story points completed per sprint
- **Burn-down Rate**: Progress toward sprint/release goals
- **Cycle Time**: Time from task start to completion
- **Bug Rate**: Defects found per feature/sprint
- **Customer Satisfaction**: User feedback and feature adoption

### Meeting Management
- **Stand-ups**: 15 minutes max, focus on progress and blockers
- **Sprint Planning**: 1-2 hours per week of sprint duration
- **Retrospectives**: What went well? What could improve? Action items
- **Backlog Grooming**: Regular refinement of upcoming work

### Tool Recommendations
- **Project Tracking**: Jira, Azure DevOps, Linear, or GitHub Projects
- **Communication**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord
- **Documentation**: Confluence, Notion, or GitHub Wiki
- **Time Tracking**: Harvest, Toggl, or built-in project tools

### Timeline Estimation Guidelines
- **New Feature Development**: 2-6 weeks depending on complexity
- **Bug Fixes**: 1-5 days depending on severity and scope
- **Infrastructure Changes**: 1-3 weeks with testing and rollout
- **Documentation**: 20% of development time for new features
- **Testing**: 30-40% of development time for comprehensive testing

### Team Dynamics
- **Cross-functional Teams**: Include developers, designers, QA, and product owners
- **Definition of Done**: Clear criteria for when work is truly complete
- **Code Reviews**: Required for all changes, 1-2 reviewers minimum
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Tech talks, pair programming, documentation
- **Work-Life Balance**: Sustainable pace, avoid consistent overtime

### Budget and Resource Management
- **Team Composition**: Balance of senior and junior developers
- **Skill Development**: Time for learning and professional growth
- **Tool Costs**: Factor in licensing, infrastructure, and third-party services
- **Contingency**: 10-20% buffer for unexpected requirements
