# AI Team Bot - Default Knowledge Base

## What is the AI Team Bot?

The AI Team Bot is a multi-persona AI agent designed for Discord to assist software development teams. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide contextually relevant answers from a project-specific knowledge base.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Persona System**: Different AI "personas" (e.g., Project Manager, Lead Architect) can be directly mentioned for targeted queries
- **RAG Integration**: Uses retrieval-augmented generation to provide context-aware responses
- **Discord Integration**: Native Discord bot with @mention support
- **Proactive Interjection**: Can understand conversation context and contribute without being mentioned

## How to Use

1. **Direct Mention**: Use @BotName followed by your question to get a general response
2. **Persona Mention**: Mention specific personas like @JohnPM for targeted expertise
3. **Natural Conversation**: The bot can join conversations contextually when relevant

## Technical Architecture

The bot is built with:
- Python and discord.py for Discord integration
- pydantic-ai for structured AI agent behavior
- Cerebras API with Meta Llama models for inference
- Vector-based RAG system for knowledge retrieval
- Docker containerization for deployment

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Core RAG Engine
2. **Phase 2**: Discord @Mention Integration (Current)
3. **Phase 3**: Multi-Persona Team & Dynamic RAG
4. **Phase 4**: Dockerization & Context-Aware Interjection
5. **Phase 5**: Polish, Documentation, and Submission

## Getting Started

To run the bot:
1. Set your DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN environment variable
2. Run `python main.py discord` to start the Discord bot
3. Invite the bot to your server with appropriate permissions

For CLI testing:
- Run `python main.py <knowledge_base> <question>` for direct queries
